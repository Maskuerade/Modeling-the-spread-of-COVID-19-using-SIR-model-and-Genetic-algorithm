# $${\color{violet}{Modeling\ the\ spread\ of\ COVID-19\ using\ SIR\ model\ and\ Genetic\ algorithm}}$$
---
*   In the last few years, the world has witnessed unprecedented and dramatic loss due to the horrifying pandemic, COVID-19, that invaded many countries around the globe leaving behind a tragedy that has led to numerous death and infection cases
*    Thatâ€™s why modeling the spread and genetic mutations of the Novel disease, Covid-19, has been of interest to researchers in the past few years.
*    This Repository is a documentation of our study that's mainly focused on using a genetic algorithm as a proposed approach, for fitting the curve of the SIR model, aimed towards obtaining the parameters of the Kermack-McKendric SIR model(Susceptible, Infectious, ,and Recovered)
*  the genetic algorithm is used to select the fittest generation by mocking the selection phenomenon that occurs in nature.

## The Repository contains the following:
---
* The report containing all of our findings and work
* the poster of the project summarizing our work
* Link to the website which contains a simulation of the model : https://sir-simulation.vercel.app/index.html
